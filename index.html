      <h2>101. Intro to JavaScript</h2>
      <p>In the beginning there was mosaic...then Netscape...then the browsers wars...</p>
      <p>Netscape envisioned a more dynamic web that took the server out of the equation, well not fully out, but you get what I am saying. She browser based. </p>
      <p>Functionally to Websites...you see.</p>
      <p>liveScript...jscript...woah woah this is too much lets standardize.... ECMAScript, ok? </p>
      <p>java vs javaScript: java has as much to do javaScript as Cars have with carpet. Interpreted vs complied language. Js is interpreted. Line by Line interpeted vs. entire recipe translated </p>
      <h2>102:JavaScript Alerts</h2>
      <p>alert("hello world");  //Yup,that's a pop up window for you.</p>
